    <p>Singapore is a small city-state located in South-East Asia which borders Malaysia. The country is officially
      just 56 years old (!!!) which is likely younger than many of you reading this blog. The country first 
      became an area of international interest after it established itself as the world's largest publically
      owned shipping port. This allowed for a constant influx of new people from different backgrounds to enter the 
      country and leave their mark on its culture. This is partially why the population is so diverse and unique 
      in its makeup. The Singaporean government also enacted the 'Speak Good English' movement in 2000 to promote 
      the adoption of English as the country's main language in order to increase tourism. The movement was a huge 
      social and cultural success and likely played a large role in bringing you to this blog. <p>

                <p>Singapore is also known as the 'Garden city' due to how green and natural it is. Creations like the cloud 
                  dome have helped foster and mantain this image that attracts millions of visitors every year. <p>

                <img src = "images/president.jpg" alt = "Picture of current Singaporean president Halimah Yacoub" width="200"/>
                <p>Halimah Yacoub is Singapore's current president and the first female president in the country's history. She 
                   has helped create a safe and prosperous environment in Singapore which has allowed the local population to 
                   flourish and tourism to increase year-in-year-out.<p>

        <p>Welcome to my travel guide! My name is Tarush Nandrajog. I am currently a sophmore at the University 
           of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but I have lived in Singapore for just under 10 years over 2 different stints
           and so I know all of the ins and outs of the country. As you can see from the baby photo, I am a big fan
           of cricket, as well as football and basketball. In highschool my friends and I also spent a lot of time 
           at many of the beaches in Singapore, with my personal favourite being Tanjong Beach. Enjoy the sunset photo
           displayed from the last time I went.</p>
